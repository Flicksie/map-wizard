# Map Wizard Test

## Overview

This is as basic as a React project can be. Not a lot of fluff and using as little libraries and frameworks as possible.

Components created from scratch on demand. Using only Tailwind;

Nothing too fancy on the mocked backend calls. I considered writing a fake HTTP wrapper for axios but that would be beyond the scope of this test. A fake call as a function will yield similar results since it is async anyway;
